          In this case, it represents a generic animal.

          The Mammal class extends the Animal class using the extends keyword, which means that Mammal is a specialized type of Animal.
          It inherits all the public and protected members (fields and methods) from Animal and can also add its own unique members
          or override the inherited ones.

          The Reptile class also extends the Animal class, indicating that Reptile is another specialized type of Animal. 
          It inherits the common properties and behaviors from Animal and can have its own additional members or overridden methods.
